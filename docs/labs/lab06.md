title: Lab 06. Paper Prototypes and BOMs
draft: false
---
Today, you will demonstrate your looks-like paper prototypes. The point of the paper prototype is to have a clear idea of how your system will work before you commit to a design. That also means that you need to take the paper prototype seriously: something that simply looks like your design but doesn't attempt to function like it will not tell you enough about which parts you need.

For these paper prototypes, really work out all the details of how the design will operate. If there will be a screw somewhere, draw it, mock it up with a pin, or somehow represent it on your paper prototype. The process of building it will teach you a lot about what is feasible. If you need a Wizard of Oz script, don't be satisfied with hand-wavy "it will just work." Look at the details.

## Project Paper Prototypes
### Setup and critique
Set up your paper prototype on your table, and prepare to demonstrate how it will work. Be prepared to ask questions and answer questions. Have your BOM ready. Expect critique!

Once you've set up, take turns in your group explaining your prototype. Once everyone in the group has heard and critiqued each other's prototypes, roughly half the group can start to circulate around the room. Switch when you're ready. Someone should be at the group table at all times to demonstrate the prototypes, but don't leave just one person there the whole time.

### Get TA feedback
Your TAs should give you brief feedback on what works and doesn't work about your prototype. You will have at least one in-depth meeting with your TA about your project, but not today. Don't think of this as "approval" as much as the first step in an on-going iterative process to improve your prototype. No design is ever perfect immediately!

## Lab
For next lab, you'll want to extend your line following from Lab 04. If you were successful in driving from line to line, extend your algorithm to follow a line. If you already got line following to work, refine your approach.

You may consider using the lab's IR sensors. Some teams prefer to use them because they can be hand-calibrated.

As usual, you will be marked on the following scale:

- 5: Exceptional demonstration of lab concepts (exceeds requirements)
- 4: Good demonstration of lab concepts (meets requirements)
- 3: Reasonable demonstration of lab concepts (one or two requirements unclear)
- 2: Missing one or two lab concepts
- 1: Missing most lab concepts
- 0: No attendance/no completion.
