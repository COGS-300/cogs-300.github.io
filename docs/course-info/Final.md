# Final Exam
The final exam will look almost exactly like the design challenges that you receive in class. The best way to study for the final is to practice your design challenges in class, get good at expressing yourself visually, and to get feedback on your work.

We will provide four design challenge prompts. You will choose two and answer them. The best answers will include drawings, annotations, and explanations of the drawings.

## Cheat Sheet
You can bring one hand-written double-sided letter-sized piece of paper to the final exam. A non-programmable calculator is allowed. Any standard drawing tool is allowed. Arduino components or other physical thinking tools are allowed as long as they do not display information. Headphones are not allowed. If you need more than this to be successful, you are encouraged to sign up with the [UBC Center for Accessibility](https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility/).

## Example exam question

Imagine that you have been hired to design the car-following system for a Tesla competitor. Relying on your knowledge of ultrasonic distance sensors, your experience with wall-following, and the "follow-me" challenge, design a system that:

Keeps a car at a specific speed except when another car is detected in front.
If there is a car detected in front, maintains a specific distance from that car, no matter what the speed.

You can assume that whatever distance detection system the car uses works exactly like an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino. 

- Draw a diagram of the scenario overall, including the different cases that your design needs to account for. Don't draw your final design yet, just a high-level example.
- What are the sources of error that might need to account for? Draw examples of errors that your system would have to account for and briefly explain the error.
- How would you mitigate the error in terms of physical component design? Draw your physical component design and briefly explain your strategy for mitigation.
- How would you mitigate the error in terms of algorithmic design? Write out pseudocode and/or a flowchart and explain which algorithmic techniques you would use.
- How would your system work overall? Write out pseudocode and/or flowcharts and diagrams to explain your system design.
- How does your system compare to the way that humans follow each other? What's similar and different?
