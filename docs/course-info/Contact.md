**Discussion**

You are highly encouraged to join the [COGS Discord](http://www.ubccogssoc.ca/resources.html), but no course announcements or teaching staff communication will happen through Discord. Paul is on the Discord (@phb), but doesn't really check it, and certainly has no access to the COGS 300 channel so can neither answer questions there nor see discourse about the course. We will be asking for course reps to take feedback from students, so the Discord is intentionally partitioned so that you can talk about the course without fear of being monitored by Paul. TAs may be on the COGS 300 channel at their own discretion, but Paul will never ask for a report on who is saying what.
