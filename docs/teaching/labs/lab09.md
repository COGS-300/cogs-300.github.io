title: Lab 09. Model Tournament
draft: true
---

## Overview
[Link to Lab 09](/labs/lab09)

This lab is a model of the full tournament. Encourage students to build small, achievable versions of the bigger problems that they will encounter in the full tournament. 


## Materials and Prep

## TODOs
1. Outline the tournament rules and goals.
2. Help break down tournament challenges into achievable goals.
3. Post-mortems, as usual.
4. Remind them that their paper prototypes are due next lab.


## Slides

Generate slides using [Marp](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli). If you're using the CLI, save the following to `lab09.md` and run `marp lab09.md`.

# Lab 09: Model Tourament
Today is all about practicing the tournament. Break down each challenge into achievable versions of the more complex challenges in the final tournament.

---
# Tournament Rules
- your robot must be entirely autonomous
- use only equipment available in lab
- be sporting and fair

---
# Tournament Metrics
- Play for speed, prize is bonus marks
- Re-running time-trials is allowed (be fair)
- Every interaction with your robot is a 1-minute penalty
- You cannot gain any distance with an interaction

You *can* run an AI system on your computer and have it send commands to your robot. However, the system must still be strictly autonomous and every human intervention will incur a 1-min penalty.

---
# Tournament Prizes
- Bonus marks for top speed in each challenge 
- Bonus marks for top speed overall 
- Bonus marks for final tournament win (top teams from each lab)

It is not always the case that the same teams get all the bonus marks. Sometimes, one team excels at one challenge, and does poorly on another challenge. In that case, they will get bonus marks for the challenge they excel at (if they are the fastest).
