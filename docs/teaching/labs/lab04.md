title: Lab 04. Telemetry
draft: true

## Overview
[Link to Lab 04](/labs/lab04)

This lab is our introduction to telemetry, which was not part of the curriculum last year. Therefore, it might not go very smoothly, so be prepared to reduce the stress of students and communicate with me about how difficult things are.

My hope is that the major ideas that we really focus on are as follows:
- Getting encoder data from the wheels
- Recording logs on a remote machine such as our laptops and inspecting them
- "Remote" control, i.e., driving the robot from the computer


## Materials and Prep
Since you haven't learned this yourself, do follow through the full lab on your own. You should be confident in wiring an encoder, making a telemetry system, making a remote control system, and potentially even doing some Bluetooth control. This is harder than it seems, even with pre-made code.

For example, string processing can often go wrong on Serial monitor, and requires a lot of configuration. If people are just copy-pasting code, it might not seem obvious what the communication problem is. If you haven't encountered some of the problems yourself, you might also be stuck.

However, we can let this be a learning process as well. We're trying something new with new hardware, and it's always a bit rough.


## TODOs
1. Get them into their project groups.
2. Inform them of post-mortem procedures.
3. Get them rolling on the lab.
4. Go around and do first post-mortems.
5. Help out with telemetry stuff.

## Slides

Generate slides using [Marp](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli). If you're using the CLI, save the following to `lab04.md` and run `marp lab04.md`.

# Lab 04: Telemetry
Today we'll use encoders to determine robot movements.

---
# Post-mortems
Post-mortem procedure:
- Everyone says one new thing that worked well about working together this week.
- Everyone says one new thing that didn't work well about working together.
- Everyone says how they contributed to the project.
