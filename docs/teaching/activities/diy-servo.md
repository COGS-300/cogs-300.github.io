# Do-It-Yourself Servo

## Introduction
Now that you understand how to [use a servo](/teaching/activities/servo), you may want to understand how they work. As you saw in class, the inside of a servo consists of a DC motor, a series of gears, a rotational encoder, and a control board. We're going to break that out into large scale so that you can understand each component on its own.

### Materials
- Rubber bands
- Cogs, gears, and wheels
- 3mm Barbeque skewer or similar sized stick
- Potentially the equivalent of above in Lego
- Potentiometer

## Activity
### Create a direct-drive rotational encoder
Create a rotational encoder by attaching a BBQ skewer to a potentiometer knob with a rubber band. Figure out a way to measure the amount of rotation of the skewer using the knob. You may need to perform an experiment, e.g., try a certain number of turns of the skewer and see how far the knob turns.

### Create a drive train
To increase both the precision and the amount of force that the model servo can output, let's introduce a drive train. Using a series of gears or pulleys with rubber bands, make it so that many turns of the BBQ skewer results in only a small amount of movement of the potentiometer knob. Figure out the new ratio of number of turns of the BBQ skewer to angle of the potentiometer knob.

### Simulate a control algorithm
Come up with an algorithm that will determine the BBQ skewer movement. Choose a target angle to turn the knob to. Then turn the BBQ skewer either forwards or backwards. Try to be as precise as possible: if the potentiometer is close to the target angle, should you spin the BBQ skewer slower or faster? Put this behaviour into your algorithm.

### Make the servo continuous
How could you make this servo continuous? There are ways to do it, but you'd have to break the potentiometer (don't break the lab ones) and add some kind of counter using a button.

## On your own
### Create an electronic version of the DIY Servo
The DIY servo is a large physical model of a real, working servo. But, it doesn't have any electronics. You can replace your finger turning the BBQ skewer with a real DC motor. Adjust the drive train so that the DC motor can freely turn, but still handle the force of turning the knob. Implement your control algorithm.

## Philosophical Connection
A real servo is just the eletronic DIY servo, but in a more highly-engineered little package. There's a phenomenological and functional difference between the DIY servo and the manufactured servo, but is there a categorical difference? Often, we assume that categorical similarity is total equivalence, but clearly your DIY servo is not functionally equivalent to a manufactured servo. 

This matters when we talk about the difference between models, theories, and categories. Try to imagine a servo built out of entirely different parts. For example, using only soft components, or using pneumatics to drive the motors. Is it still a servo? When does that matter? Similarly, if you can build a servo out of an Arduino, but an Arduino is much more powerful than a servo, is it "just" a servo when it's acting as one?
