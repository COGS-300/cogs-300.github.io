# Pitches and Sketches
Your project pitch will be a little written blurb with one or more sketches. The sketches should be "good enough" to convey your idea fully, but not a finished design. This might feel a little unusual: yes, we're asking you to leave things a bit unfinished. However, it should not be so unfinished as to be useless. There's a balance. Put a "medium" amount of effort in.

Designers use sketches to work out ideas and to get feedback. You will get feedback on your sketches from your group mates and TAs. You should put enough effort into your sketches that there's a real "idea" in there, but not so much that you get emotionally attached to the idea. Sometimes design is about deferring decisions.

Write a very short blurb that describes your idea. It should only be a few sentences long. The purpose is to be able to speak clearly about your idea, so that when your group mates or TAs as you, you can easily respond about what you're planning on making.

You can change your idea later. In fact, we expect you to. Later, you will make a paper prototype. That will be more "finished" and will look a lot more like your final product. Now, it's just a sketch.

## Handin
Put your pitch and your sketch(es) in your sketchbook. Then, take a picture of them and submit them to Canvas. We will mark them Credit/D/Fail.
