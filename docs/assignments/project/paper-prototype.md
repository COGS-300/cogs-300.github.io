# Paper Prototype and BOM
Just like in Lab 02, you should make a paper prototype of your project. Unlike your sketch, you should be committed to this idea. In fact, the purpose of the paper prototype is that it should help you work out enough details about your project to be able to make a bill of materials and order parts.

The paper prototype does not literally have to be paper, but you are certainly encouraged to build it out of cardboard. Any parts that are interactive should be accompanied by a storyboard or drawing that indicates how the prototype should work. For example, if a light goes on, draw the light off, then on. Or, if a robot arm moves, draw the arm moving.

The paper prototype needs to be detailed and "work" as if it was your final project, but without electronics. You should be able to act out everything that your final project will have. Use the opportunity to hone your ideas without the expense of trying parts that don't work. If it's difficult to build in paper, it'll be much more difficult to build with electronics.

Along with your paper prototype, create a bill of materials (refer back to Lab 03). This is a drawing of your project from at least one perspective that details all of the parts that you'll need. You are not allowed to make a very expensive project for this course: all parts should add up to be less than $50. Write down your parts as a list on your bill of materials and indicate their prices.

The quality of this prototype should be high. No magical thinking: if anything is "wizard of oz," it should be grounded and realistic. You are still allowed to change your project after this, but you really should be trying to get as close as possible to a representation of the final design.

## Handin
Put your BOM in your sketchbook. Then, take a picture of it and submit it to Canvas. Take a short video of your paper prototype and post it to Piazza. Both are individually marked Credit/D/Fail.
