# Works-Like Prototype
In this lab, you should be showing off a working circuit and mechanical system. The project does not need to be "done" but it needs to be significantly progressed. All your electronic parts should be in, and they should all "work" at this point.

For example, you might have four servo motors that control the eyeballs and eyebrows of a face. You should at least have each servo working on its own. Maybe the eyeballs aren't fully finished, but you've put at least a piece of styrofoam on a servo and shown that it can move around. 

The point of this prototype is to catch catastrophic failures. Yes, your project can still change if there is a failure, but you should be doing your best to not have them happen last minute. Many people learn at this point that their motors are not strong enough, the material they have been thinking about using will break if they put that amount of force on it, they don't have enough battery power to run something, etc. Plan ahead to fail.
