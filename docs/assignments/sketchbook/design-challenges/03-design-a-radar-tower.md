## Design an Ultrasonic Sonar Tower
Now that you have access to high-precision motorized systems like a servo, and you have access to long-distance range sensors like an ultrasonic, you can build a [sonar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar) tower (which is like a [radar tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar), but with sound).

Build a fully-working roughly 180 degree sonar tower using servos (or geared DC motors and some motor sensing system) cardboard, one or more ultrasonic sensors, and a cardboard/lego base. The sonar tower needs to actually work, even if the materials are paper or lego.

Add Arduino code so that you can make an array of distances from the tower. You may want to build a Processing sketch to visualize your tower's measurements (yes, AI-built code is fine here).

The best designs will include filtering. You might want to think carefully about how your Sonar Tower makes a measurement. There are many options for how to design a system that gets an "accurate" picture.


## Design solution format and handin

You should draft your design solution in your sketchbook so that we can talk about it when we consult your sketchbook. You should draft before you present a final set of photos to us.

Make a presentable, clean version in your sketchbook, reflect on the module and your learning, justify and give yourself a grade from 0-5. Upload a photo of your reflection and presentable version of the design challenge for review. Also upload enough photos that we can reasonably understand how your prototype was actually built.

The reflection should be a paragraph or two on the course concepts, tying them into your personal understanding of the course. Include a short justification for the mark that you've given yourself in terms of your participation in class, engagement with the readings, and work on the design challenge.

The design challenge is due about two weeks after the assignment released (will be indicated on Canvas).
