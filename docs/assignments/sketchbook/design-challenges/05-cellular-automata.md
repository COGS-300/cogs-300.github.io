# Design Your Own Cellular Automata

For this design challenge, you're being asked to design your own cellular automata system system based off of Conway's Game of Life. It must be different than existing sytems that we studied in class such as Langton's Ant, Conway's Game of Life, SmoothLife, or similar derrivatives, but can be heavily inspired by them.

There are many good options for an extension. You can think about the grid system, the substrate on which the grid acts, the dimensionality, the kinds of rules that are applied, or much more. 

The one rule is that the system must be truly _cellular_. That is, the system must operate on a "grid" of some kind where each cell reacts to its neighbours (defined in a broad sense), rather than there being an "agent" that has goal-directed behaviour of any kind. If an agent emerges from the cells, that is a happy and expected behaviour of the system, but it cannot be that there is an intention "programmed" into the agent.

## Design solution format and handin
To demonstrate your agent, draw and annotate the following system components:
- The grid: what defines a cell?
- The substrate: what does the cell "live on"?
- The state: each cell's possible state
- The transition rule: what makes cells change state?

Then "simulate" your agent on paper until you can detect an emergent pattern. Characterize at least three key emergent patterns (i.e. species) for your system.

If you would like to do a computer simulation, that is acceptable, but not required. If you choose to do that, still make a drawing for your sketchbook, but also post a video to Piazza, and say you did in your sketchbook.

The reflection should be a paragraph or two on the course concepts, tying them into your personal understanding of the course. Include a short justification for the mark that you've given yourself in terms of your participation in class, engagement with the readings, and work on the design challenge.

The design challenge is due about two weeks after the assignment released (will be indicated on Canvas).
