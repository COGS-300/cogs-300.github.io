# Introduction Module: Estimate a Building
For this design challenge, you are being asked to estimate the size of a building using similar methods to those we did in class. This is an exercise in estimation, so you are not required to be "correct" in your measurement, but you should be rigorously estimating error. Do not put yourself in danger to measure anything, i.e., don't climb anything or hang out of a window, etc.

- Choose a building on UBC campus to estimate the size of. The building must be at least three storeys.
- Make an accurate scale diagram of the outline of the building from at least two perspectives (e.g., front and side, or 45° view and front).
- Include major architectural details such as roofs, windows, doors, eaves, courses, etc. at scale.
- Annotate your drawing with your scale, units, measurements, and the methodology for estimation. Include a description of your error estimation and calculations of lower and upper bounds for measurements.

You do not have to make a very "pretty" drawing, but it should be clean enough that you are able to make reasonably accurate estimates using the drawing. You can use reference photographs, but do not include the photographs in the finished drawing. It's fine to use digital drawing tools at some point in the process, but the final drawing needs to be on paper, hand-drawn, and in your sketchbook. If you need to print something for some reason, staple or tape it into your sketchbook. No excuses if you're bad at drawing: use a ruler and trace if you "can't draw"! You're encouraged to make preparatory sketches to show us before handing in.

## Design solution format and handin
Each design solution, including this one, should include **two** short reflections and self-provided grades in the range of 0-5. Yoru final design and relfections should be in your sketchbook. The reflection grades must be very clearly marked (highlighted, circled, at the top of the page, something), or we will count it as zero. You will submit a photo of the final design and reflections to Canvas.

The first reflection and self-provided grade should assess your design challenge: how well did you think that you did the design challenge? Provide a short justification for your self-given grade and reflect on the connection between the design challenge and course concepts.

The second reflection and self-provided grade should assess your participation in the course: over the module, did you fully engage in the pre-readings? Did you do the in-class drawing exercises and design challenges to the best of your ability? Provide a short justification and reflect on your changing understanding of COGS as a result of the module.

The best reflections do not linger long on self-promotion. Instead, they focus on course concepts. Use this first design challenge as a practice run.

For this course, we always use the following kind of scale:
- 5: Exceptional: above and beyond requirements, brings in outside knowledge and/or deeply engages with the material.
- 4: Very good: meets requirements fully, no major critiques.
- 3: Good: mostly meets requirements, one or two major critiques or many minor critiques.
- 2: Poor: mostly pro forma meeting of requirements, many major or minor critiques.
- 1: Very poor: some discernable effort, but significant problems.
- 0: No discernable effort.

You will notice that "fully meeting requirements" is only a 4/5, or 80%. This is unusual for many people, but is standard in art and design courses. The secret requirement is that you must go above and beyond to get above 80%. The point is to get you to creatively engage with the course. If we fully specify what it takes to get 100%, then there will be no creative component. Part of the purpose of engaging with this in this manner is to teach you to assess yourself in your own creativity. Then, we will assess you on your self-assessment. Don't worry, this will seem natural soon enough.

Since this is your first design challenge, we will provide some ideas of above and beyond:
- Very well done and/or highly-detailed drawings
- Creative measurement processes that use multiple tools or perspectives
- Unusual and fully worked-through estimation techniques
- Extra building perspectives that include analyses of smaller sections of the building
- Etc.

The design challenge is due two weeks after the assignment released (will be indicated on Canvas).
