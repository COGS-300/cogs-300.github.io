You will be required to maintain a **physical**, hand-written sketchbook. Your sketchbook should be a record of your creative engagement with the course. Everything should be recorded in it: daily drawings, in-class design challenge, module design challenges, and project sketches and documentation.

The sketchbook must be **physical**, it cannot be virtual. The sketchbook needs to be **physical** because we will be using it to communicate in lecture, labs, office hours, and design reviews. It all needs to be in one place and it needs to be able to be passed around. If there's ever something you design on a computer, print a version of it and attach it to your sketchbook. The first thing I will usually ask a student is "show me a drawing" and this is the way you do that.

## Design Challenges
Every module (about every two weeks), you'll be required to hand in a photo or scan of a design challenge and an accompanying reflection. The design challenge will be an expansion of one of our class activities guided by our do this "on your own" suggestions given during or after the activities.

Importantly, **you will be proposing two grades for yourself**:
- 0-5 for your participation in pre-readings and in-class exercises (drawings, design challenges)
- 0-5 for your module design challenge and reflection

Your TAs will then review your proposed grade and modulate it depending on your recorded participation and demonstrated work. If you are consistently proposing a high grade, but you have poor-quality work, are not showing up to class, are late, are working on other things than COGS 300 during lectures or labs, we will reduce your self-grade. That being said, most people get the grade they give themselves.

## Sketchbook review
To receive your sketchbook grade, you must meet with your TA once during the term for a review (marked and detailed on the [project page](/assignments/project)). 

You will also hand in your sketchbooks at the end of term, where they will be assessed for _completeness_ only. That is to say, we will briefly flip through to make sure you did the drawing exercises and design challenges to check against your self-mark.
