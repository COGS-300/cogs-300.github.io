# W11. Learning 04
Today, we learn about extending feedback and evaluation loops so that evaluation can happen automatically. We also introduce perceptrons, the basis of historical and modern machine learning. We go from the basic self-adjusting cybernetic system, to the first visions of a layered self-adjusting cybernetic system.

## Pre-readings and Videos
The readings explain the basic idea of a perceptron, with a cool electronic example.

### Analog Perceptron

A beautiful demonstration of a perceptron using an analog system.

### Original Perceptron Paper
[McCulloch and Pitts' original research paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02478259) that defined the mathematical model of a neuron.

### Original Perceptron Engineering Paper
[Rosenblatt's original research paper](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1959-09865-001) that described his perceptron machine.

## Learning Goals
1. Design a reward function that can be computed "live".
2. Understand the basic perceptron as introduced by McCulloch and Pitts and originally implemented by Rosenblatt.
3. Design a single perceptron's weights to achieve a specific classification task.
