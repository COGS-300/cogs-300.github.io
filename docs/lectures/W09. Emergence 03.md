# W09. Emergence 03
Today, we introduce simple swarms, which are multi-agent systems. The difference between a swarm and cellular automata is that a swarm is comprised of agents that act over a surface or environment, whereas the cellular automata emerges out of the environment itself. The cellular automata are at the "atom" level, where we can see the emergence of higher-level structures like cell walls. The swarms are at the "cell" level, where we can see the emergence of cell bodies, specialized parts, and "multi-cellular" organisms. Again, although nothing is "intelligent" in any of the agents in these swarms, when allowed to interact, complex structures start to emerge, and something like "decisions" seem to start to happen.

## Pre-readings and Videos
The simulations we will see today illustrate different types of simple swarms. Here are the papers, videos, and websites that explain the phenomena in detail.

### Physarum
This video explains a kind of slime mold that exhibits intelligent behaviour without having a brain or a central nervous system.

Along with the video, there are many interesting readings for physarum. [Sage Jenson's Physarum](https://cargocollective.com/sagejenson/physarum) artistic exploration into physarum gives a fascinating and beautiful demonstration of emergence, as well as a good technical explanation of how to model physarum. Importantly, even this excellent computer model is nowhere near powerful enough to accurately model a real slime mold.

Physarum builds off of our understanding of Langton's Ant and Conway's Game of Life, where the environment and agent is not a clear distinction. This is a [demonstration of the externalization of cognition](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1215037109).

### Traffic Waves
A very simple (nearly) 1-dimensional model of emergence in a multi-agent system using a real-life phenomenon known as a "traffic snake," where drivers on a highway will slow down at a particular point even though there is no "good reason" to do so.

Here is a good, simple website explaining the phenomenon: [trafficwaves.org](http://trafficwaves.org/).

Here is a good, simple website simulating the phenomenon: [traffic-simulation.de](https://www.traffic-simulation.de/ring.html)


### Flocking
If we allow our agents to have longer-range sensing, group behaviours emerge that seem to express collective intelligence. [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) are a good example of simulating [flocking](https://processing.org/examples/flocking.html) behaviours in birds, schools of fish, or other animals that form large groups. In our class terms, this would be like having a swarm of PID robots trying to maintain distance on all sides. These physics-based simulators again do not exhibit actual intelligence at the individual level, yet very much look like they do at a group level.
