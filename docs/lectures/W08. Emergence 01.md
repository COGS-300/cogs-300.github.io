# W08. Emergence 01
Today, we really start to dig into complexity science 101: automata. If you've taken a discrete math course, you've probably already seen finite state machines (FSMs) a.k.a. deterministic finite state automata (DFAs). 

Automata are a good model for the robot, because it is an automaton. But also, they are a good model for intelligent emergence, that is, when intelligent behaviour seems to emerge out of unintelligent actions. Further, some automata demonstrate a further property of complex systems called chaos.

The following readings

### Langton's Ant
This is a simulation of [Langton's Ant](https://josephpetitti.com/ant). Langton's Ant is a simple automaton that produces chaotic and therefore "unpredictable" behaviour, yet it is deterministic.

### Cellular Automata Rules
An enumeration (and index) of cellular automata based on a structured rule pattern can exhibit behaviour that is both chaotic and complex. In fact, certain [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110) are Turing-complete, that is, they can compute.

### Conway's Game of Life
Another famous cellular automaton is [John Conway's Game of Life](https://playgameoflife.com/). Conway tuned the rules of this automaton to produce "life-like" patterns, i.e., it

### Sphex Wasp and Determinism
The [Sphex Wasp](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09515089.2012.690177) has often been cited as an example of a natural automaton. But is it true? Is intelligence even possible without memory?

On the other hand, very [intelligent systems with impairment may also exhibit repetition](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/stages-and-symptoms/dementia-symptoms/repetitive-behaviour).
