# W08. Learning 02
Today we will learn how to use multiple sources of sensor data for classification. We will compare a single classification stage (where all sensor data is integrated into the same decision tree) with a multi-stage classification approach, where different sensors are fed into different models. The ultimate purpose will be to allow the robot to make decisions with multiple simultaneous classification objectives.
