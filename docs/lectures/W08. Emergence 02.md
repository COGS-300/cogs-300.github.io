# W08. Emergence 02
Today we will discuss systems theory and variations on Conway's Game of Life. These are generalizations of the discrete form of cellular automata that Conway developed. One form of generalization is in allowing for different rule sets to be explored. Another is to allow for the spatial resolution to increase, making the "squares" almost continuous. Another is to change the values that can be applied, e.g., allowing the squares to be "greyscale" and vary between 0 and 1. Finally, the transition functions can be changed, allowing for more complex relationships between pixels.
