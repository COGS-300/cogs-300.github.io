# W04. Control 01
This is the beginning of the Control module. Last time, we modelled a servo and saw a complete but simple control loop. The potentiometer was used for rotational encoding. However, our robots move too far to just use rotational encoding. We need to translate rotation to linear motion. 

Today, we will build a 1D linear encoder using an optical encoding setup. To perform [localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_navigation) and find out "where we are," we need to reconcile the readings from the encoder with a map. The map could be as simple as "distance from zero" or as complex as the interior of a multi-floor building. The process of getting real-time data from sensors (such as an encoder) is called [telemetry](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/telemetry/telemetry.html). Even though the word implies remote sensing, it's often used to mean any data collection from sensors.

## Learning Goals
1. Design and build a simple optical encoder.
2. Take readings from an encoder and translate into distance and speed readings.
3. Reason about basic problems with telemetry, including the sensing loop, timing, and errors.
