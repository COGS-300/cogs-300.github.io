<!-- !!!!! IMPORTANT PAUL YOU HAVE TO INTRODUCE ULTRASONICS TODAY!!!! -->

# W04. Control 01
This is the beginning of the Control module. Last time, we modelled a servo and saw a complete but simple control loop. The potentiometer was used for rotational encoding. However, our robots move too far to just use rotational encoding. We need to translate rotation to linear motion. 

Today we will learn how to perform [localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_navigation) and find out "where we are." We need to reconcile the readings from the encoder with our other senors, and a map. The map could be as simple as "distance from zero" or as complex as the interior of a multi-floor building. The process of getting real-time data from sensors (such as an encoder) is called [telemetry](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/telemetry/telemetry.html). Even though the word implies remote sensing, it's often used to mean any data collection from sensors.

The long-range distance sensor for this course is the [ultrasonic distance sensor](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/Isaac100/getting-started-with-the-hc-sr04-ultrasonic-sensor-7cabe1). Eventually, we will learn to reconcile the two different sensors (encoder and ultrasonic) through a process called sensor integration.

## Pre-readings and Videos
The readings today cover encoders and localization and compares robot movement and control to human body movement and control.

Another classic McWhorter video on the distance sensor. It will give you the practical understanding of how to wire and use the sensor.

### How Sonar Works
<YouTube id="AqqaYs7LjlM" />
This video explains how sonar works in some detail. Although the ultrasonic does have different properties due to the frequency range it works in, it is essentially a sonar technology that we're using.

### How Ultrasound Imaging Works
<YouTube id="I1Bdp2tMFsY" />
This video briefly explains how ultrasound imaging works. Although the ultrasonic sensors we're using have a different configuration and use case, the underlying mechanism is the same. Understanding the many different applications of ultrasonic waves can help us understand our specific use case of distance sensing.

## Learning Goals
1. Design and build a simple optical encoder.
2. Take readings from an encoder and translate into distance and speed readings.
3. Reason about basic problems with telemetry, including the sensing loop, timing, and errors.
