# W09. Emergence 04
The swarms we looked at last time were very unintelligent: they had very short distance sensing ranges, and they had no onboard memory. Any "memory" that the system as a whole had was encoded directly in the environment. If we allow our agents to have seemingly simple things like memory and long-distance communication, we suddenly enable non-local swarm effects, which starts to look a lot like intelligent behaviour. 

However, it will take some time in class for us to get there. Today, we will start to move from simple swarms to complex swarms by learning about message-passing.

## Learning Goals
1. Analyze swarm message-passing in terms of distance and memory.
2. Characterize consistency and liveness of messages in distributed systems.
3. Design a protocol and encoding to send messages over long distances.
